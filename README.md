A young man named John, who in order to get a summer job decides to work nights as a night security guard in a small shopping center.

He will be accepted very quickly, and for a one night test he will have to spend the night watching the shopping center, however his boss asked him first of all to visit the shopping center to find 10 videotapes that were misplaced by the previous night watchman who disappeared in a bizarre situation and condition.

Certainly even if for John this situation is quite strange, he still accepted the job, since the proposed salary was super-interesting, who could let this opportunity pass?
